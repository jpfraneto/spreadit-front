This is the front end of the new application that is being developed within the frame of The Open Source Factory.

It is called 'Spreadit', name that is inspired by the concept of the market spread, which is the difference between the selling prize of an asset in a market (the lowest prize that a holder is willing to receive), and the buying prize (the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay).

The goal of this application is for users to be able to create alerts on different cryptocurrencies markets, so that with them they can be better informed about what to do with their investments.
